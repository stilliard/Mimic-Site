This is an older lib i wrote a couple years back, originally called Mimic site but im slowly moving it to Ditto.php

### Todo
- Tidy up the main index fie / refactor it a bit
- Clean up the file/directory structure
- Refactor methods to Ditto.php class file
- Add support for REGEX replacements! :D
- Consider alternative config file type instead of xml. (im not keen on on having to use <![CDATA[ for all the HTML fragments)
